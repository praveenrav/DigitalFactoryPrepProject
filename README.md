### Digital Factory Preparation Project

This project serves as a method to become introduced, familiarized, or more skilled in the various concepts relevant to the development of an IoT-based Digital Factory.

Targetted towards beginner programmers, this project touches on Node.js, HTTP, MongoDB, InfluxDB, MTConnect, code documentation, and code testing.

The server is created via a Node.js application, utilizing the Express.js library to create the RESTful API endpoints. 

To run the server, navigate to the "DF Node.js Workspace" folder in a terminal window and run `node .\main.js`.

Given the server is running locally on port 3000, documentation for the API endpoints can be found on "http://localhost:3000/api/docs", made available via the Swagger library.

Additionally, test cases were created for a few of the endpoints via the use of the JEST library. However, for this project, the majority of the testing of the API endpoints were performed using **Postman**.
